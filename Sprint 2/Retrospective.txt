Retrospective
Participants: Hyunjae Cho, Han Gu, Yingqin Wang, Zongye Cen, Tongyu Zhu

Questions
What process aspects will be changed? Why? 
Do each scrum meeting every two days so that there is less pressure for team workload
Redistribute the work assignment and dedicate more hours to front end 
Make sure we all answer 3 questions during the scrum meeting
Make sure to review the gitflow best practices before committing
Break down the feature list into more specific tasks in sprint backlog
Remember to write comments for each refractor branch and issue

What tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review feedback? 
Write more specific acceptance tests for every single feature 
Minor UI adjustments: color of the banner, texts of the banner and column name

Sprint #2 Feedback

Things to fix:
1. need all possible inputs including in the acceptance test for login. eg login shows the login forms, clicking bottom to send to a page, check the text on the bottom being "Create User"
2. change the home page banner to color gray (#787878) with text "USC CS310 Stock Portfolio Management" 
3. Change “pairs” on the left stock column to “tickers”

Other Requirements:
1. Portfolio value and stock are on the same graph and nothing needed to done to make the chart easy to read
2. Stock not in the portfolio can be added to the graph
3. Mobile Device UI test: everything that changes need to be tested (via pixel size)
